# Workspace Switching URL Update Fix

## Issue
When users switched workspaces in the application, the workspace data correctly updated to reflect the new workspace, but the browser URL did not update to include the new workspace ID. 

For example:
- User is on `/w/workspace_001` (Acme Marketing Agency)
- User switches to "Global Media Solutions" (workspace_004)
- Data updates correctly to show workspace_004 data
- **Problem**: URL remained at `/w/workspace_001` instead of updating to `/w/workspace_004`

## Root Cause
The workspace switcher component (`GV_TopNavigation.tsx`) was calling the `switchWorkspace` store action, which updated the Zustand state but did not trigger any URL navigation. React Router requires explicit navigation calls to update the browser URL.

## Solution
Updated the `workspaceSwitchMutation` in `GV_TopNavigation.tsx` to include URL navigation logic:

### Changes Made

**File**: `/app/vitereact/src/components/views/GV_TopNavigation.tsx`

1. **Added React Router hooks** (line 2):
   ```typescript
   import { Link, useNavigate, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
   ```

2. **Initialized navigation hooks** (lines 60-61):
   ```typescript
   const navigate = useNavigate();
   const location = useLocation();
   ```

3. **Enhanced workspace switch mutation** (lines 107-127):
   ```typescript
   const workspaceSwitchMutation = useMutation({
     mutationFn: async (workspaceId: string) => {
       await switchWorkspace(workspaceId);
       return workspaceId;
     },
     onSuccess: (workspaceId) => {
       setWorkspaceSwitcherOpen(false);
       queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['notifications'] });
       
       // Parse current path and update workspace ID
       const currentPath = location.pathname;
       const pathSegments = currentPath.split('/').filter(Boolean);
       
       if (pathSegments.length >= 2 && pathSegments[0] === 'w') {
         // Replace workspace ID in path (e.g., /w/workspace_001/campaigns -> /w/workspace_004/campaigns)
         pathSegments[1] = workspaceId;
         const newPath = '/' + pathSegments.join('/');
         navigate(newPath, { replace: true });
       } else {
         // Navigate to workspace overview if not on a workspace path
         navigate(`/w/${workspaceId}`, { replace: true });
       }
     }
   });
   ```

## How It Works

1. When a user clicks on a workspace in the dropdown, `handleWorkspaceSwitch` is called
2. This triggers the `workspaceSwitchMutation` which:
   - Calls `switchWorkspace(workspaceId)` to update the Zustand store
   - On success, parses the current URL path
   - Replaces the workspace ID segment in the path
   - Navigates to the new path using React Router's `navigate()` function
3. The URL updates and all workspace-specific routes are preserved (e.g., `/w/workspace_001/campaigns` becomes `/w/workspace_004/campaigns`)

## Testing

Tested with user `jane.smith@example.com` who has access to multiple workspaces:
- Initial workspace: Acme Marketing Agency (workspace_001)
- Switched to: Global Media Solutions (workspace_004)
- Result: URL correctly updates from `/w/workspace_001` to `/w/workspace_004`

## Benefits

1. **URL Consistency**: Browser URL always matches the current workspace
2. **Deep Linking**: Users can bookmark workspace-specific URLs
3. **Navigation History**: Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
4. **Route Preservation**: Maintains current route (e.g., campaigns, settings) when switching workspaces
5. **Better UX**: Users can see which workspace they're in from the URL
